/**
 * Who somebody is, across evenings.

 * Firebase anonymous auth gives each browser a uid. That is the right
 * identity for one evening — it is what every security rule keys off, and it
 * is what stops one player writing another's card. It is the WRONG identity
 * for a year of history: clear your browser, play on a borrowed phone, or
 * reinstall, and you are a stranger to your own record.
 *
 * So there is a second identity that is deliberately weaker and deliberately
 * durable: a friend profile the player picks from a list, or creates once.
 * No account, no password — this is eight people who know each other, and the
 * threat model has never been somebody impersonating a friend to inflate a
 * board game scoreboard. What it buys is that history survives a new phone.
 *
 * The two are kept strictly apart. The uid stays the security identity and is
 * what the rules check. The friendId is a LABEL carried alongside, used only
 * for grouping history. Nothing is authorised because of it.
